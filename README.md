# Mirror

Mirror is a utility to take a whole GitHub organisation and re-create all the repositories
in GitLab as mirrors incase of the eventual GitHub outage that is scheduled to destroy your
productivity.

## Usage

### Private repositories

For private GitHub repositories you must first log into the GitLab interface, click on new
project. Then click the "Import project", then click the GitHub button. Make sure to
**grant access to the organisation you with to import from**
